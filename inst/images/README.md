### CRFS District Map

'CRFS District Map.pdf' is a map of the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) Districts.
California is divided into six regions based on
management boundaries,
distance that recreational boats are likely to travel, and
county lines.

The [districts](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/CRFS/Survey-Design)
from north to south include

  * Redwood district - Del Norte County and most of Humboldt County.
  * Wine district - Shelter Cove section of Humboldt County and Mendocino County.
  * San Francisco district
  * Central district
  * Channel district
  * South district
